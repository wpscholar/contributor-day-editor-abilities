/**
 * React, taken from the copy WordPress already put on the page.
 *
 * WordPress registers React as a classic script that assigns `window.React`.
 * Bundling a second copy is the single biggest cause of plugin breakage on the
 * React 19 upgrade, because elements created by one runtime are rejected by the
 * other, so every `react` import in this bundle is aliased here instead.
 *
 * The export list is written out by hand: an ES module has no way to re-export
 * an object's properties dynamically, and the bundler needs to see each name at
 * build time to link it.
