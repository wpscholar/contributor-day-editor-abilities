# Contributor Day Editor Abilities

WordPress plugin that registers **client-side block editor abilities** via [`@wordpress/abilities`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-abilities/), exposes them to browser AI agents through [WebMCP](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/webmcp), and ships a chat panel that drives those tools using the site's own AI connector.

Requires **WordPress 7.0+** (client-side Abilities API and AI Client).

## What it does

On block editor screens the plugin:

1. Registers a `block-editor` ability category
2. Registers twenty editor abilities (inspect / query / mutate the live editor)
3. Bridges each ability to `document.modelContext.registerTool()`, installing the [WebMCP polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mcp-b/webmcp-polyfill) when the browser has no native support
4. Adds an **AI Chat** sidebar that can call those tools

There is also a standalone **Tools → AI Chat** screen running the same panel, to show the chat is not tied to the editor.

| Ability | WebMCP tool name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `editor/get-editor-tree` | `editor_get-editor-tree` | Full hierarchical block tree (optional `maxDepth`) |
| `editor/find-editor-blocks` | `editor_find-editor-blocks` | Find blocks by text / name / attribute; returns flat summaries |
| `editor/get-block-location` | `editor_get-block-location` | Parents, root, and index for a block |
| `editor/insert-block` | `editor_insert-block` | Insert a block, with nested `innerBlocks` (optional parent / after) |
| `editor/move-block` | `editor_move-block` | Move a block within or between parents |
| `editor/update-block` | `editor_update-block` | Merge attribute changes into a block |
| `editor/transform-block` | `editor_transform-block` | Convert a block to another block type in place |
| `editor/remove-block` | `editor_remove-block` | Remove a block and everything nested inside it |
| `editor/get-editor-selection` | `editor_get-editor-selection` | Current selection state |
| `editor/select-block` | `editor_select-block` | Select a block, without touching the document |
| `editor/can-insert-block` | `editor_can-insert-block` | Whether a block type can be inserted |
| `editor/get-block-types` | `editor_get-block-types` | List registered block types, filtered by search / category / insertability |
| `editor/get-block-type` | `editor_get-block-type` | One block type in full: attribute schema, nesting rules, styles, variations |
| `editor/undo` | `editor_undo` | Undo the last change to the document |
| `editor/redo` | `editor_redo` | Redo the last undone change |
| `editor/get-patterns` | `editor_get-patterns` | List available patterns, filtered by search / category / block types / destination |
| `editor/get-pattern` | `editor_get-pattern` | One pattern as a block tree, optionally with its markup |
| `editor/get-pattern-categories` | `editor_get-pattern-categories` | Pattern categories, registered and user-created |
| `editor/insert-pattern` | `editor_insert-pattern` | Insert a pattern at a location |
| `editor/create-pattern` | `editor_create-pattern` | Save blocks as a new pattern on this site |

Ability names keep the `namespace/name` form. WebMCP tool names replace `/` with `_` (some agents reject `/` in tool names).

Behavior worth knowing when calling these:

- Unknown client IDs are an error, never a silent no-op. Passing a stale `afterClientId` to `editor/insert-block` fails instead of inserting at the top of the document.
- `editor/find-editor-blocks` returns each match once as `{ clientId, name, attributes, innerBlockCount }`, so a match nested inside another match is not duplicated. A supplied `clientId` scopes the search and includes that block itself.
- `search` is the way to find a block by the words shown in the editor: it is a case-insensitive substring match over the block's string attributes, and it also matches with markup and common HTML entities resolved, so `Chloe` finds `<strong>Chloe Nolan</strong>`. A `value` passed without an `attribute` is treated as `search` rather than matching every block.
- `attribute` matches on presence; add `value` to compare, which is done as a string (objects and arrays compare as JSON).
- `editor/move-block` takes `afterClientId` / `beforeClientId` (the sibling's parent becomes the destination) or an explicit `rootClientId` + `index`. Indexes are the block's position after the move. Moving a block into itself or a descendant is an error, as is a move the editor refuses because of a lock.
- `editor/insert-block` takes `innerBlocks` (recursive `{ name, attributes, innerBlocks }`), and container blocks have to be built that way. An empty `core/columns` renders a layout placeholder rather than an inner block list, so the editor registers no block list settings for it and refuses every child until it has inner blocks — a two-column layout must be inserted as one `core/columns` holding two `core/column` blocks. Nesting the block types forbid (`core/column` outside `core/columns`) fails before anything is inserted.
- `editor/update-block` merges the attributes you pass; anything you omit is left alone. Attribute keys the block type does not define are rejected with the list of keys it accepts, since unknown keys are stored but never saved.
- Attribute values are checked against the shape the block type declares, and defaults nested inside `query` sources are filled in. Those defaults are otherwise only applied while parsing saved markup, so a `core/table` cell set programmatically without its `tag` would render an undefined element and break the block.
- `editor/get-block-types` is how to discover blocks the theme or a plugin registered, which no model knows in advance. It omits attribute schemas to stay small; `editor/get-block-type` returns one block in full, including the style variations and the `is-style-*` class name that applies each. Blocks hidden from the inserter are excluded unless `includeHidden` is set, and passing `rootClientId` narrows the list to what that block will actually accept.
- `editor/transform-block` uses the block type's own registered transforms, so it keeps content that a remove-then-insert would lose. A refused target comes back with the list of types the block can become, and one transform can produce several blocks (a list becomes one paragraph per item).
- `editor/undo` and `editor/redo` drive the editor's history, so a person can also step through the agent's work with the toolbar buttons. Each editing ability lands as its own undo step; there is no batching yet, so reverting a five-call edit takes five undos.
- Ability failures come back as MCP tool errors with a readable message rather than rejecting the tool call.

### Patterns

- `editor/get-patterns` is the pattern counterpart of `editor/get-block-types`: it answers "what layouts does this site already have" before an agent assembles one block at a time. It lists registered patterns (core, theme, plugin, pattern directory) alongside the patterns saved on this site, and omits markup so the list stays small. Each entry carries `rootBlockNames` and `blockCount`, so a pattern can be judged without fetching it.
- Pattern names keep the form the editor uses. Registered patterns are named by their author (`twentytwentyfive/hero`); a pattern saved on this site is `core/block/<id>`, after the `core/block` block that references it.
- Passing `rootClientId` to `editor/get-patterns` narrows the list to patterns whose top-level blocks the destination will actually accept, which is how to avoid offering a template-part pattern inside a post.
- `editor/get-pattern` returns blocks as `{ name, attributes, innerBlocks }` — the shape `editor/insert-block` and `editor/create-pattern` accept, and deliberately without client IDs, since none of those blocks are in the document.
- `editor/insert-pattern` copies an unsynced or registered pattern in as ordinary blocks, and inserts a synced pattern as a single `core/block` reference, which is what the editor does. Pass `asReference: false` to copy a synced pattern's blocks in as an independent, editable set instead. Every top-level block is checked against the destination first, so a pattern that does not fit fails before anything is inserted.
- `editor/create-pattern` saves either blocks already in the document (`clientIds`) or a structure supplied directly (`blocks`). Sync status follows core: `unsynced` writes the `wp_pattern_sync_status` meta and inserts independent copies, `synced` omits it and keeps every instance in step. A category with no term behind it yet gets one created, the same as the editor does, and the response reports which were created.
- `replaceSource: true` swaps the source blocks for a reference to the new synced pattern, which is the editor's own "Create pattern" behavior. It needs `syncStatus: 'synced'` and blocks that sit next to each other under one parent.
- Creating anything requires an account that may create `wp_block` posts; that is checked up front so the failure reads as a permission problem rather than a REST error.
- Pattern data is fetched over REST, so the first pattern call on a page load waits on that request. Later calls are served from the store.

### Synced patterns in the tree

A synced pattern (`core/block`) owns its content as a separate entity, so `editor/get-editor-tree`, `editor/find-editor-blocks`, and `editor/get-editor-selection` reach into it through the editor's controlled-inner-block plumbing rather than the block itself, and mark the block with `controlledInnerBlocks: true`. Blocks below that marker are shared: editing one changes every post using the pattern, and the change is saved with that pattern rather than with the post, so `editor/undo` does not necessarily cover it. A pattern nested inside itself stops the walk and is reported as truncated.

## Chat

The chat panel talks to whichever AI provider the site has configured under **Settings → Connectors** (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, or anything else that registers with the AI Client). It never holds credentials of its own.

### How a turn works

WordPress 7.0 keeps the AI Client server-side, so the chat is split across the two:

1. The browser lists the WebMCP tools the current page registers and sends them, with the conversation, to `POST /wp-json/contributor-day/v1/chat`.
2. PHP declares those tools as function declarations on `wp_ai_client_prompt()` and runs **one** model turn.
3. If the model asked for tools, the browser runs them against the live page and posts the results back. This repeats until the model answers with text (8 rounds by default).

Conversation state lives entirely in the browser, so the endpoint is stateless and the same chat works on any screen. Assistant turns are replayed verbatim from the parts the previous response returned, which keeps provider-specific details such as function call IDs intact across rounds.

Gemini is the exception: it requires the thought signature it issued with a function call to come back with that call, and WordPress 7.0's AI Client does not yet carry signatures out of a provider response, so there is nothing to replay. When a turn fails for that reason it is retried once with the tool calls and results replayed as a text transcript, and the browser reports the working mode back so the rest of the conversation skips the failed attempt.

### Where the tools come from

The chat offers whatever the page registered with WebMCP — nothing is hard-coded. In the block editor that is the twenty abilities above, so the assistant can read the block tree and edit the post. On the standalone screen there are usually none, and the chat answers questions instead. Tools registered by other plugins on the same page are picked up automatically.

Tools this plugin registered are called through their own executor. Anything else goes through `document.modelContext.executeTool()`, which the polyfill always provides and native Chrome provides as an optional extension.

Tool names are rewritten server-side to the character set every provider accepts (`editor_get-editor-tree` survives as-is; dots become underscores) and mapped back before the browser sees them.

### The interface

The panel is a React app built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components and the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev)'s `useChat`. Because WordPress 7.0 keeps the AI Client server-side, there is no AI SDK provider to point `useChat` at; instead `src/chat/transport.ts` implements a custom `ChatTransport` that calls the REST route once per round, runs the tools the model asked for against the page, and emits the whole exchange as one streaming assistant message.

React itself is **not** bundled. WordPress already puts React 18.3 on the page, and core [asks plugins not to ship a second copy](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/07/24/react-19-punted-beyond-wordpress-7-1-experiment-in-gutenberg/), so the build rewrites every React import to read WordPress's globals. Sharing the runtime is also what lets the editor sidebar render the panel as ordinary `PluginSidebar` children.

Tailwind is loaded without Preflight, since that reset would strip WordPress's own admin styling off any screen the chat appears on. The styles the components need are re-applied scoped to `.cdchat`.

### Using the chat elsewhere

Add an entry under `src/entries/` that renders `<ChatPanel />`, register it in `vite.config.ts`, and enqueue it:

```tsx
import '@/styles/chat.css';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { ChatPanel } from '@/components/chat-panel';

createRoot( document.getElementById( 'my-chat' )! ).render(
	<ChatPanel
		getContext={ () => ( { screen: 'my screen', notes: 'Extra system prompt context.' } ) }
		suggestions={ [ 'What can you do here?' ] }
	/>
);
```

### Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `contributor_day_chat_capability` | Capability required to use the chat. Defaults to `edit_posts` |
| `contributor_day_chat_model_preference` | Preferred models, best first |
| `contributor_day_chat_system_instruction` | The full system instruction |
| `contributor_day_chat_max_tool_rounds` | Tool rounds per message. Defaults to `8` |

The endpoint runs arbitrary prompts against the site's connector, so it is gated on a capability rather than on being logged in. Narrow `contributor_day_chat_capability` if `edit_posts` is too broad for your site.

```

Two layers with different build stories. Everything under `js/` is hand-written native ESM resolved through WordPress import maps (`@wordpress/abilities`, `@contributor-day/*`) with no build step. The chat panel under `src/` is compiled, but keeps `@contributor-day/webmcp-tools` and `@contributor-day/chat-config` as import-map externals rather than bundling them — the tool layer has to be the *same* module instance the ability bridge registered into, or the chat would see an empty tool registry.

The polyfill is the one exception: its ESM build imports `@cfworker/json-schema` as a bare specifier, which the import map has no entry for, so the self-contained IIFE build is enqueued as a classic script instead. It installs itself on load and steps aside when the browser has native WebMCP. Classic scripts run before deferred modules, so `document.modelContext` exists by the time any module looks for it. Run `npm run vendor` to refresh the copy after bumping the dependency.

## Local development (WP Playground)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Playground auto-mounts this directory as `wp-content/plugins/contributor-day` and starts WordPress at [http://127.0.0.1:9400](http://127.0.0.1:9400) (admin login is enabled by default).

The chat panel is compiled, so `npm run build` is required before it will appear — `build/` is gitignored. If you forget, the admin says so instead of showing nothing. Use `npm run dev` while working on it.

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build the chat panel into `build/` |
| `npm run dev` | Rebuild the chat panel on change |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting |
| `npm start` | Start Playground with this plugin mounted |
| `npm run start:reset` | Wipe stored site data and restart |
| `npm run vendor` | Re-copy the WebMCP polyfill from `node_modules` |
| `npm run zip` | Build, then create `dist/contributor-day.zip` for distribution |

To exercise the chat, install one of the official provider plugins ([Anthropic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-anthropic/), [Google](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-google/), [OpenAI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-openai/)) and add an API key under **Settings → Connectors**. Without one, the panel loads and says so rather than failing on send.

## Testing WebMCP

The polyfill means tools register in any browser on a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). Native Chrome support (`chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing`) takes precedence when present, and the [Model Context Tool Inspector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/model-context-tool-inspec/gbpdfapgefenggkahomfgkhfehlcenpd) extension is useful for confirming what an external agent would see.

Open **Posts → Add New** (or edit any post) and check DevTools:

```js
window.contributorDayEditorAbilities
// { abilityNames, webmcp: { supported, registered, skipped, errors }, isWebMCPSupported }

await document.modelContext.getTools();
// every registered tool, whichever implementation is in play
```

The chat sidebar shows the same count next to the Send button; hover it for the list.

## Distributable zip

```bash
npm run zip
```

Builds the panel, then writes `dist/contributor-day.zip` containing only plugin runtime files (`contributor-day.php`, `includes/`, `js/`, `css/`, `build/`), with source maps stripped. `build/`, `dist/`, and `*.zip` are gitignored.
